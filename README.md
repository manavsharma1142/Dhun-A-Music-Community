# Dhun - A Music Community

**Dhun** is a web-based application built to bring together users who share similar music interests. It allows people to discover others with overlapping artist preferences, creating a space to connect, share, and explore music taste socially.

## 🌐 Project Overview

The idea behind Dhun was to create a mini social platform where users with the same music vibe can discover each other. From artists like AP Dhillon and Charlie Puth to Drake and MC Stan, Dhun categorizes preferences and links users through their listening patterns.

The project uses a full-stack JavaScript architecture, combining modern UI techniques with robust backend data handling.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB (for storing user accounts, favorite artists, and preferences)
- **Templating**: Handlebars (`.hbs` files used for dynamic rendering)

## 🧠 Key Features

- Sign-up/Login system for user authentication
- Selection and storage of favorite artists
- Discover other users with shared preferences
- Dynamic routing and content rendering using Handlebars
- Clean and responsive UI layout

## 💡 Why This Project?

Dhun was created as an exploration of how music connects people. Instead of building just another music listing app, the goal was to foster community and relatability based on musical choices. It also provided a good opportunity to sharpen full-stack skills using real-world components like user login systems, templating, and database design.
